      <description>Postgres doesn&amp;rsquo;t support active-active replication natively. As of this writing, we have to rely on 3rd party tools. I decided to go with BDR.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up multiple VMs. So, the obvious choice is docker. Make sure you have docker on mac &amp;amp; docker compose.
Step1: Running 2 Postgres instances using docker container Thanks to jgiannuzzi. He created a docker image with Postgres and BDR.

      <description>I hope you gone through Part1 of this series. Perhaps, one thing you might have noticed is that I&amp;rsquo;ve to connect to the specific master database. In our case, since both the databases are running on docker, only the localhost port is different. (In production environment, most likely you going to run the databases on different host). The main reason for active-active replication is high availability. If one of the node goes down, you still want your application to behave normally.</description>
