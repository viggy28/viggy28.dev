---

TLDR; A short book on Product Development and especially explains how
B2C (especially social media) companies make their users hooked on their
products. Though Product owners, designers, and founders can use this
book in improving their products, every user can read this to understand
why some of the popular apps do things (like infinite scroll, weekly
digest emails, notifications) which we use day-to-day. Hooked also
overlaps with Nir Eyal’s other book
[Undistractable](https://viggy28.dev/book/undistractable)

It starts with the fact that 79% of smartphone owners check their device
within 15 minutes of waking up every morning. (*I am one of those 79*)

[Nir Eyal](https://twitter.com/nireyal), the author of the book
introduces a model called Hooked which consists of 4 steps:

1.  Triggers
2.  Action
3.  Variable Reward
4.  Investment

**Chapter 1 - The Habit Zone**:

-   Companies want to create a habit of using their apps which gives
    higher customer lifetime value (CLTV), greater pricing flexibility,
    growth, and a competitive edge
-   Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) then
    they become must-haves (painkillers) and they alleviate users’
    discomfort by relieving a pronounced itch.

**Chapter 2 - Trigger**:

-   Triggers cue the user to take action and they are two kinds:
    -   **External**
        -   Triggers which tell the user what to do next. (Eg: push
            notifications, sign up email, etc)
    -   **Internal**
        -   Triggers which tell the user what to do next through
            associations stored in the user’s memory (Eg: negative
            emotions, FOMO)
-   To build a habit-forming product, makers need to attach the user of
    their solution to a frequently felt internal trigger

**Chapter 3 - Action**:

-   Action is the simplest behavior in anticipation of reward. Eg. Sign
    up with Facebook, Infinite scroll in Pinterest, or Likes on Twitter.
-   Dr. Fogg’s Behavior model states that for any behavior to occur, a
    trigger must be present at the same time as the user has sufficient
    ability and motivation to take action.
    -   **Behavior = Motivation (M) \* Ability (A) \* Trigger (T)**
    -   To increase the desired behavior, ensure a clear trigger is
        present; next, increase ability by making the action easier to
        do; finally, align with the right motivator.
    -   Motivator generally falls under one of these three
        1.  Seeking pleasure and avoiding pain
        2.  Seeking hope and avoiding fear
        3.  Seeking social acceptance
    -   Ability is influenced by six factors:
        1.  Time
        2.  Money
        3.  Physical effort
        4.  Brain cycles
        5.  Social deviance
        6.  Non-routiness.
    -   Nir suggests optimizing first for Ability (later for Motivator).
        If its too difficult whatever the motivation, the user is not
        going to use it.
    -   Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts we take to make quick
        decisions. Few examples are
        1.  The Scarcity Effect - *The appearance of scarcity affected
            their perception of value.* Eg. Amazon shows only 5 items
            left
        2.  The Framing Effect - *The mind takes shortcuts informed by
            our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous
            judgments.* Eg. When a famous artist performs their art in a
            crowded place
        3.  The Anchoring Effect - *People often anchor to one piece of
            information when making a decision* Eg. When brands give
            offers
        4.  The Endowed Progress Effect - A phenomenon that increases
            motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal. Eg. A
            LinkedIn profile which how much we have completed details

NOTE: **Thinking Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman is a great book on
the topic Heuristics, Cognitive biases

**Chapter 4 - Variable Rewards**:

-   What draws us to act is not the sensation we receive from the reward
    itself, but the need to alleviate the craving for the reward.
-   Only by understanding what truly matters to users can a company
    correctly match the right variable reward to their intended
    behavior.
-   Too many companies build their products bettings users will do what
    they make them do instead of letting them do what they want to do.
-   There are 3 types of rewards:
    1.  Tribe - Search for social rewards fueled by connectedness with
        other people
    2.  Hunt - Search for material resources and information.
    3.  Self - Search for intrinsic rewards of mastery, competence
-   When our autonomy is threatened, we feel constrained by our lack of
    choices and often rebel against doing a behavior.

**Chapter 5 - Investment**:

-   Unlike the variable rewards, which delivers instant gratification,
    the investment phase concerns the anticipation of reards in the
    future. Since it comes after the variable reward phase when users
    are primed to reciprocate.
    -   Eg: StackOverflow where experts write answers (sometimes very
        detailed) which gets rewarded by points in the future
        -   NOTE: Give And Take by Adam Grant is a great book to read on
            reciprocation. Highly recommended.
-   Anything you spend time on, you start to believe, “This must be
    worthwhile. Why? Because I’ve spent time on it! (I can correlate it.
    I have done it. Realized its a mistake too late).
-   Investments increase the likelihood of users returning (means they
    will be passing through the Hook again) by improving the service the
    more it is used.

**Chapter 6 - What Are You Going to Do with This?**:

-   Nir introduces something called Manipulation Matrix ![Manipulation
    Matrix](/images/hooked-manipulation-matrix.jpg) *I think it can also
    be used as an employer matrix. When choosing an employer one can use
    that to see which category their employer is*

**Chapter 7 - Case Studies**

-   A couple of case studies which enumerates the principles discussed
    earlier.
