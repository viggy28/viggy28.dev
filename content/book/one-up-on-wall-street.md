Disclaimer: This book was published in 1989. So, we have to time travel
to understand a few things, but overall the concepts are still relevant.
Also, read this during COVID-19 ([middle of a global
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash)).

This review is a little different than other books. Going to share most
of the notes as points.

**Peter Lynch is America’s money manager. He was Vice-Chairman of the
Fidelity Management & Research Company. He was the portfolio manager of
Fidelity Magellan Fund, which was the best performing fund in the world
from May 1977 to May 1990.**

**Chapter 1 - Preparing to invest:**

-   If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings.
-   Market cap = no. of outstanding shares \* stock price of individual
    share
-   You only had to find one big winner out of eleven. The more right
    you are about anyone stock, the more wrong you can be on all the
    others and still triumph as an investor.
-   Keep your ears open (especially when your friends/family members say
    something).
-   **Don’t invest on companies which you don’t know.**
-   Author says professional investing is an oxymoron.
-   Failure hurts more than success gives happiness.
-   Stocks are most likely to be accepted as prudent at the moment
    they’re not.
-   Peter gives an analogy of stock trading with Playing poker. Keeping
    up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless
    stud-poker hand. He says *investment is a gamble in which you’ve
    managed to tilt the odds in your favor.*
-   Six out of ten is all it takes to produce an enviable record on Wall
    Street.
-   He recommends buying a house first before investing. - Great advice.
-   One of the tricks is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but
    rather to discipline yourself to ignore them.
-   [The cocktail
    theory](https://www.onemint.com/2009/opinion/peter-lynch-cocktail-theory/).
    (Like how everyone is talking about \$MSFT).
-   Don’t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals.
-   Take advantage of what you already know.
-   The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and
    products years before the professionals. (Yeah, I have been using
    Zoom \$ZM since 2016. Know them well when they went IPO and I didn’t
    buy :sad smiley: )
-   Common stocks aren’t for everyone, not even for all phases of a
    person’s life.

**Chapter 2 - Picking Winners:**

-   Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never
    looking at the cards. (I need to look at myself in the mirror).
-   Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific
    reasons for holding the stock. (It is going up! doesn’t count).
-   By putting your stocks into categories you’ll have a better idea of
    what to expect from them.
-   Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a
    specific product.
-   Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven
    that their concept can be replicated.
-   Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a
    year. (I think he is talking about all the tech IPOs happening in
    2020)
-   Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. (I will stay away from \$ZM for
    some time)
-   Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be
    diworseifications. (diworseifications- the word he likes so much.
    Oh, another one is tenbagger. Man, this guy even in dreams scream
    tenbaggers !!)
-   It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a
    company’s plans are working out.
-   **Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of
    favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street**
-   Moderately fast growers (20 to 25%) in nongrowth industries are
    ideal investments.
-   When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the
    ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with
    loads of bank debt.
-   Find a storyline to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s
    progress. (It’s like an elevator pitch for 2 minutes)
-   Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.
-   Study the dividend record of a company over the years and also how
    its earnings have fared in past recessions.
-   Companies with little or no institutional ownership (I doubt how
    many of such growth companies exist these days)
-   All else being equal, favor companies in which management has a
    significant personal investment and doing insider buying.

**Chapter 3 - The Long-term view :**

-   Sometime in the next month, a year or 3 years, the market will
    decline sharply (This statement aged well)
-   Market declines are great opportunities to buy stocks in companies
    you like.
-   Trying to predict the direction of the market over one or two years
    is impossible.
-   To come out ahead you don’t have to be right all the time, or even a
    majority of the time.
-   Stock prices often move in opposite directions from the fundamentals
    but long term, the direction, and sustainability of profits will
    prevail.
-   Just because a company is doing poorly doesn’t mean it can’t do
    worse and similarly because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re
    right and vice versa.
-   Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is
    cheap is a losing technique.
-   If you don’t think you can beat the market, then buy a mutual fund
    and save yourself a lot of extra work and money.
