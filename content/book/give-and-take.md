**Chapter 1** is Good Returns which explains the Dangers and Rewards of
Giving more than you get with multiple examples. One of the things which
striked me

> You can’t just ignore someone because you don’t think they’re
> important enough.

I can’t agree more on that. I have seen first class that founders making
this mistake. Its so easy to just ignore, but think about the long term
or big picture. First chapter, goes over some of the examples of givers
approaches. Especially David Hornik some of his quotes and thoughts are
note worthy

> I want to demostrate that success doesn’t have to come at someone
> else’s expense

> He pays more attention to what other people need than to what he gets
> from them

**The Five-Mniute Favor**

Adam Rifkin, giving is governed by a simple rule: the five-minute
favor.“You should be willing to do something that will take you five
minutes or less for anybody”

The above rule really made an impact on me and I totally agree with
that. So, I created a list of companies where I can refer my
connections.

On **chapter 3**, author talks about Ripple effect. How giving creates a
good for everyone involved.

*Extensive research reveals that people who give their time and
knowledge regularly to help their colleagues end up earning more raises
and promotions in a wide range of settings, from banks to manufacturing
companies.*

I had a question on the above statement. Why do Individual Contributors
then getting huge benefits (at least in the tech world). I twitted Adam
Grant the same (you know it doesn’t cost anything to tweet :) ),

**Chapter 4** is about Finding the Diamond in the Rough. I was
particularly interested in this one. Prof C.J. Skender

> simply starts by seeing everyone as talented and tries to bring out
> the best in them.

For many years, psychologists believed that in any domain, sucess
depended on talent first and motivation second. However, the recent
researched have proved that its other way around. He backs that with
many research data. This line really striked me.

**Natural talent also matters, but once you have a pool of candidates
above the threshold of necessary potential, grit is a major factor that
predicts how close they get to achieving their potential**

One of the important qualities of a mentor is they made the initial
learning very pleasant and rewarding.

**Chapter 5** is about the Power of Powerless Communication - certainly
something I would like to improve.

-   Presenting: The value of vulnerability
-   Selling: Separating the Swindlers from the Samaritans
-   Persuading: The technique of Tentative talk
-   Negotiating: Seeking advice in the shadow of a doubt

**Chapter 6** is about the art of motivation maintenance. Basically, how
to persist your maintenace. I think this is the secret.

***When people know how their work makes a difference, they feel
enrgized to contribute more***

Giving should be for enjoyment and purpose rather than duty and
obligation.

The more one gives, the better one feels; and the better one feels about
it, the easier it becomes to give.

Chump Change is **chapter 7**. The ability to recognize agreeable takers
as fakers is what protects gives against being exploited.

****Some of the actions for impact**:**

1.  Test your giver quotient
2.  Run a reciprocity ring
3.  Embrace the Five-Minute favor
4.  Practice powerless communication, but become an advocate
5.  Join a community of givers
