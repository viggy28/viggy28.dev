Mark my word. We had so many competitions in the past. Eg. vim vs emacs, tabs vs spaces etc. The new comparison which is added in this decade is functions vs containers

Both the functions and containers can be serverless. So, please avoid the notion of serverless means functions. In fact, predominantly all the functions (like lambda, cloud functions) are running behind the screen as containers. (there are few products like Cloudflare workers are running without containers)

Functions Pros:

* Low barrier to entry

* Cheaper
  
Cons:

* Flexibility

* Hard to scale
