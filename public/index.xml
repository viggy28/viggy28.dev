      <description>In Google Cloud Next 2019, they introduced a new product called Cloud Run. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it from the EAP (Early Access Program) days. [As the name suggests, basically it runs your docker image. You might be familiar with other serverless products such as Cloud Function or lambda where you provide your source code instead of a docker image. In my opinion, Cloud Run is more flexible than functions. Let me explain why.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Setting up HAProxy I hope you gone through Part1 of this series. Perhaps, one thing you might have noticed is that I&amp;rsquo;ve to connect to the specific master database. In our case, since both the databases are running on docker, only the localhost port is different. (In a production environment, most likely you going to run the databases on a different host). The main reason for active-active replication is high availability.</description>

      <title>Part 1/2: How to set up active-active replication in postgres using BDR</title>

      <description>Postgres doesn&amp;rsquo;t support active-active replication natively. As of this writing, we have to rely on 3rd party tools. I decided to go with BDR.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up multiple VMs. So, the obvious choice is docker. Make sure you have docker on mac &amp;amp; docker compose.
Step1: Running 2 Postgres instances using docker container Thanks to jgiannuzzi, who created a docker image with Postgres and BDR.

      <title>Functions vs Containers</title>

      <description>Mark my word. We had so many competitions in the past. Eg. vim vs emacs, tabs vs spaces etc. The new comparison which is added in this decade is functions vs containers
Both the functions and containers can be serverless. So, please avoid the notion of serverless means functions. In fact, predominantly all the functions (like lambda, cloud functions) are running behind the screen as containers. (there are few products like Cloudflare workers are running without containers)</description>
