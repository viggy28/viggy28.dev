      <title>How to set up active-active replication in postgres using BDR</title>

      <description>Postgres doesn&amp;rsquo;t support active-active replication natively. As of this writing, we have to rely on 3rd party tools. I decided to go with BDR.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up multiple VMs. So, the obvious choice is docker. Make sure you have docker on mac &amp;amp; docker compose.
Step1: Running 2 Postgres instances
Thanks to jgiannuzzi. He created a docker image with Postgres and BDR.
docker-compose.yml file content
version: &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; services: database0: image: jgiannuzzi/postgres-bdr restart: always ports: - 54325:5432 volumes: - /Users/viggy28/tech/docker/volumes/postgres0:/var/lib/postgresql/data environment: POSTGRES_PASSWORD: &amp;lt;replace with your password&amp;gt; database1: image: jgiannuzzi/postgres-bdr restart: always ports: - 54326:5432 volumes: - /Users/viggy28/tech/docker/volumes/postgres1:/var/lib/postgresql/data environment: POSTGRES_PASSWORD: &amp;lt;replace with your password&amp;gt;  Things to note: ports - I am using my local machine&amp;rsquo;s port 54325 and 54326.</description>

      <title>Functions vs Containers</title>

      <description>Mark my word. We had so many competitions in the past. Eg. vim vs emacs, tabs vs spaces etc. The new comparison which is added in this decade is functions vs containers
Both the functions and containers can be serverless. So, please avoid the notion of serverless means functions. In fact, predominantly all the functions (like lambda, cloud functions) are running behind the screen as containers. (there are few products like Cloudflare workers are running without containers)</description>
