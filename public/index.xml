      <description>This is a guest post by Suvam Prasad (https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvamprasad/). I am very glad to have his post.
This book is very special to me because it helped me to discover new perspectives of web designing mythology. The book is written by Steve Krug(a famous user experience professional). The book contained hardly 216 pages that give you enough knowledge and idea to understand web design usability, user accessibility, and how to be a great user experience designer.</description>

      <description>TLDR; A short book on Product Development and especially explains how B2C (especially social media) companies make their users hooked on their products. Though Product owners, designers, and founders can use this book in improving their products, every user can read this to understand why some of the popular apps do things (like infinite scroll, weekly digest emails, notifications) which we use day-to-day. Hooked also overlaps with Nir Eyal’s other book Undistractable</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This book was published in 1989. So, we have to time travel to understand a few things, but overall the concepts are still relevant. Also, read this during COVID-19 (middle of a global pandemic).
This review is a little different than other books. Going to share most of the notes as points.

      <description>Part 1 is about Master Internal Triggers which talks about that distractions are mainly caused by discomfort. Most people don’t want to acknolwedge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. Being indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do.
 We are compelled to reach for things we supposedly need but really don’t. (eg. checking emails)
 We tend to blame things like television, junk food, social media etc - but these are all promiate causes of our distraction, but not the root cause.</description>

 You can’t just ignore someone because you don’t think they’re important enough.
 I can’t agree more on that. I have seen first class that founders making this mistake. Its so easy to just ignore, but think about the long term or big picture.</description>

      <description>This aricle is inspired by [Give and Take] (https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take) by [Adam Grant] (https://www.adamgrant.net/). I was wondering how can I help my friends and network. Searching a job is something stressful and we all have been through. Once my wife and I searched for a year and finally we moved to San Francisco.
So far its been a challenge for my network to know whether I can refer to a particular company.</description>

      <title>How to deploy a cloud run application using Gitlab CI/CD</title>

      <description>In Google Cloud Next 2019, they introduced a new product called [Cloud Run] (https://cloud.google.com/run/). I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it from the EAP (Early Access Program) days. [As the name suggests, basically it runs your docker image. You might be familiar with other serverless products such as [Cloud Function] (https://cloud.google.com/functions/) or [lambda] (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) where you provide your source code instead of a docker image. In my opinion, Cloud Run is more flexible than functions.</description>

      <title>Part 2/2: How to set up HAProxy for an active-active postgres databases</title>

      <description>Step 1: Setting up HAProxy I hope you gone through [Part1] (https://viggy28.dev/article/postgres-active-active-replication/) of this series. Perhaps, one thing you might have noticed is that I&amp;rsquo;ve to connect to the specific master database. In our case, since both the databases are running on docker, only the localhost port is different. (In a production environment, most likely you going to run the databases on a different host). The main reason for active-active replication is high availability.</description>

      <title>Part 1/2: How to set up active-active replication in postgres using BDR</title>
      <link>https://viggy28.dev/article/postgres-active-active-replication/</link>

      <guid>https://viggy28.dev/article/postgres-active-active-replication/</guid>
      <description>Postgres doesn&amp;rsquo;t support active-active replication natively. As of this writing, we have to rely on 3rd party tools. I decided to go with [BDR] (https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/postgres-bdr-2ndquadrant/).
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up multiple VMs. So, the obvious choice is docker. Make sure you have docker on mac &amp;amp; docker compose.
Step1: Running 2 Postgres instances using docker container Thanks to [jgiannuzzi] (https://github.com/jgiannuzzi), who created a docker [image] (https://hub.docker.com/r/jgiannuzzi/postgres-bdr) with Postgres and BDR.</description>

      <description>I am writing this around the time where we are at the beginning of a global pandemic. Everyone is trying to figure out how to keep their business up and running during this challenging period. Most of the employers have mandated work from remote policy. One of the main challenges is how to connect to your applications remotely. Traditionally the answer is VPN. There are so many challenges wrt scalability, availability, and performance of these traditional VPN software.</description>

      <description>When I first heard GPG it was little daunting. I haven’t used it exactly, even though I was familar with the concept. So, I decided to dig deeper and understand how to use it.
GnuPG (GPG) is an implementation of PGP
The simple idea is that you generate a key pair: secret or private key and a public key. You can provide your public key to anyone. They can then encrypt either a secret or file using your public key.</description>

      <title>Functions vs Containers</title>

      <description>Mark my word. We had so many competitions in the past. Eg. vim vs emacs, tabs vs spaces etc. The new comparison which is added in this decade is functions vs containers
Both the functions and containers can be serverless. So, please avoid the notion of serverless means functions. In fact, predominantly all the functions (like lambda, cloud functions) are running behind the screen as containers. (there are few products like Cloudflare workers are running without containers)</description>
