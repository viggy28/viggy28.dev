      <description>Disclaimer: Whatever I write here is my learnings. So, don&amp;rsquo;t take these words as granted or reference. Also, please lmk if there are any errors.
I have often come across this term JWT. I knew the definition - Json Web Token, but honestly that&amp;rsquo;s all I knew for a veryyyy longgg time. Recently, I came across a problem where I have been told that JWT might be a good solution for it.</description>

      <description>Libpq-Postgres-Go After I started working on Postgres, I have heard this term libpq enough times, but never had a good grasp of it. After digging around this topic for a couple of days, here is my understanding.
From the Postgres doc https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/libpq.html,
 libpq is the C application programmer&amp;rsquo;s interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a set of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of these queries</description>

      <description>Understanding context in Golang through Postgres I was trying to learn Go package context especially with respect to Postgres. On a very high level context provides context to the operation. Yeah, I agree, the previous statement doesn&amp;rsquo;t really add much value, but hold on I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to explain it, rather let&amp;rsquo;s go over some code. Sometimes its easier to understand by seeing it in action :)
The complete program is here</description>
