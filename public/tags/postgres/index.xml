      <description>Step 1: Setting up HAProxy I hope you gone through [Part1] (https://viggy28.dev/article/postgres-active-active-replication/) of this series. Perhaps, one thing you might have noticed is that I&amp;rsquo;ve to connect to the specific master database. In our case, since both the databases are running on docker, only the localhost port is different. (In a production environment, most likely you going to run the databases on a different host). The main reason for active-active replication is high availability.</description>

      <title>Part 1/2: How to set up active-active replication in postgres using BDR</title>

      <description>Postgres doesn&amp;rsquo;t support active-active replication natively. As of this writing, we have to rely on 3rd party tools. I decided to go with [BDR] (https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/postgres-bdr-2ndquadrant/).
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up multiple VMs. So, the obvious choice is docker. Make sure you have docker on mac &amp;amp; docker compose.
Step1: Running 2 Postgres instances using docker container Thanks to [jgiannuzzi] (https://github.com/jgiannuzzi), who created a docker [image] (https://hub.docker.com/r/jgiannuzzi/postgres-bdr) with Postgres and BDR.</description>
