      <description>This is a guest post by Suvam Prasad (https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvamprasad/). I am very glad to have his post.
This book is very special to me because it helped me to discover new perspectives of web designing mythology. The book is written by Steve Krug(a famous user experience professional). The book contained hardly 216 pages that give you enough knowledge and idea to understand web design usability, user accessibility, and how to be a great user experience designer.</description>

      <description>TLDR; A short book on Product Development and especially explains how B2C (especially social media) companies make their users hooked on their products. Though Product owners, designers, and founders can use this book in improving their products, every user can read this to understand why some of the popular apps do things (like infinite scroll, weekly digest emails, notifications) which we use day-to-day. Hooked also overlaps with Nir Eyal’s other book Undistractable</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This book was published in 1989. So, we have to time travel to understand a few things, but overall the concepts are still relevant. Also, read this during COVID-19 (middle of a global pandemic).
This review is a little different than other books. Going to share most of the notes as points.

      <description>Part 1 is about Master Internal Triggers which talks about that distractions are mainly caused by discomfort. Most people don’t want to acknolwedge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. Being indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do.
 We are compelled to reach for things we supposedly need but really don’t. (eg. checking emails)
 We tend to blame things like television, junk food, social media etc - but these are all promiate causes of our distraction, but not the root cause.</description>

 You can’t just ignore someone because you don’t think they’re important enough.
