      <description>This aricle is inspired by [Give and Take] (https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take) by [Adam Grant] (https://www.adamgrant.net/). I was wondering how can I help my friends and network. Searching a job is something stressful and we all have been through. Once my wife and I searched for a year and finally we moved to San Francisco.
So far its been a challenge for my network to know whether I can refer to a particular company.</description>
